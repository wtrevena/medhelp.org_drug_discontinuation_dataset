So i got an HIV test along with a few other STD tests and they were all perfect, and i talked to my docter about maybe having pinworms or some other form of parasite, so she prescribed me Albendazole, which i took, my itching seemed to go away but i found out that soda may have something to do with it,     or are all of these weird symptoms a sign of anxiety, i mean i have been really uptight and nervous due to the fact that i am moving away to go to college in a week, any connection""","[{""q1a"":{""no"":true,""yes"":false},""q1b"":{""not_confident"":true,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":false}}]"

Nope, Ive actually had several amazing years after this which is how I was able to get things back on track and come to medical school. However; symptoms (which everyone will say means nothing) have lead me back to this. I was actually forgetting all about this in terms of thinking there was a possibility of having this condition, Until a few months ago when I had 2 wisdom teeth extracted.     A few weeks after this I started to get severe burning in my mouth, a metallic taste, and dry mouth. I would almost describe it as a  ""Menthol "" like sensation. I looked in the mirror and on the lateral aspect of my tongue there was a localized white patch. My university health clinic prescribed me Nystatin swish and swallow which relieved the pain after several days on it and the lesion went away. However, it will go away and then reappear after a few days. I can always tell when its about to come because burning nearly always precedes it.     I have an appointment with an ENT tomorrow morning, and an infectious disease specialist on Tuesday. Im trying to convince myself that this is because of the 4 day course of Penicillin VK I was on 500mg, 4 times a day .... this is actually when this started. Im hoping it was the cause and not just a coincidence that I happened to be taking them.     I took another rapid HIV test yesterday and it was still negative thankfully.     Also, I tell myself this as FINALLY after 7 years, I wrote the girl this happened with and needless to say she was not happy with me but finally said she was tested for HIV when she had her 2 children.     I would literally have to be the most unlucky person if this was to turn up after all these years. One thing that is perplexing to me is why it keep coming back after 2 courses of Nystatin.

It's a start.  Scarlet37 it seems you understand what this experience means.  I have sometimes wondered about narcolepsy, as I can fall asleep very rapidly on buses etc.  Currently I take a lot of pain medication, and blame it on that, but the reality is I've always had a tendency to drop off to sleep if my environment becomes too unstimulating.  I went through a stage of some years where the paralysis was rare, and now it has returned so severely I broke my silence and told the neurologist I was seeing.  Every episode has me convinced I will never move again, or die from suffocation.  No technique gets me out of the state, I can freely step in and out of lucid dreams in the state and use these dreams to try to scare myslef awake eg. bashing myself hard - I actually physically feel the impact and pain.  Then when the dream doesn't work and I am still going seconds at a time choking for air I stop the dream and just lie there waiting and willing it all to end.  Often prior to an attack I will get a sudden and almost desperate sleepiness, not like normal tiredness.  I know it will lead to an attack but the urge to sleep is overwhelming.  I don't know, maybe it is a mild sort of narcolepsy.  Seems my nervous system is generally going bonkers over recent years.  Finally have a neurologist who is taking me seriously.  I still have the thought in my mind that so many of my problems indicate some systemic autoimmune problem, but the blood tests always come up negative for the relevant antibodies.  So many things are deteriorating all at once now, including the sleep problem.  I'm only in my early forties and was a fitness fanatic before.  Now I hobble around with a walking stick and a stack of morphine to get me through the day.  I just don't see how the sleep disorder can be unrelated.  Just moaning.  I know what a horrible condition narcolepsy is, and I am sorry you have it.  I hope you have it under control.  Seems my latest problem this week is insomnia, this is the third night in a row I've been up all night.  Starting work again in a matter of months, if I am fit, need to learn to go to bed at normal times!  Keep well.  Please let me know if you hear of any great new research.

(I was having severe anxiety attacks which is why I was put on this med)  2 years ago, because of society's stigma about this drug, I decided to get off of it.  I tapered with a dr. help, and was also put on neurotin to help prevent any possible seizures.  I got off of it.  Took many months...but I did it.\r\nTHen....my life became H**L.  I had vertigo so bad I almost had to quit my job....almost became agraphobic. Anxiety attacks returned.  Was put on all different kinds of anti-depressents to try to control veritgo.  Had several tests to rule out anything else serious.   Could not shop in a grocery store, go walk in a mall, go to a concert, do anything normal people do.  I lived that way for a YEAR.  It was horrible.\r\n\r\nWent to a new dr finally.  He put me back on Xanax, same dosage.  Vertigo gone, no more anxiety attacks.  So again, I take no more than prescribed, and no less.  Seems like my body does not need more.  I realize most people require more after time, but I have not.  \r\n\r\nI also realize that this med should not be prescribed for a long period of time.

What I am asking, is do any of you know of a supplement I can take to help give me zest back?  I have been looking for things I can take and am finding interactions, especially causing manic problems.  I am also on Trazodone for anxiety and depression.  Most of these energy boosters interact with it and diet supplements will throw me right into mania according to my psychiatrist.  BTW, I take Vitamin B complex and Flax seed oil every day, and it is supposed to help??  ARGGH!  This is frustrating and please help!  Thanks, Kristen""","""I got my BP diagnosis a year ago.  I have always suffered with lower energy levels, but since I have been put on Lithium it is a lot worse.  I have gained 15 pounds and I have no energy left to exercise.  Due to other health issues and side effects from other meds, Lithium is all I can take.  I do like the way it works, keeping me stable more than not.

They are staffed my non-MD optometrists.  You need the services of a comprehensive Eye MD ophthalmologist and a Eye MD retina specialist.  You should have been referred many years ago by the chain for your high myopia and your subnormal vision.  DON ""T GO TO THE CHAIN OPTICAL.  see your retina ophthalmologist and find a comprehensive ophthalmologist. You could even ask the retina Eye MD to recommend a good one.  While the chances of you going blind (no light perception in either eye) are extremely small you are at increased risk of retinal detachment,  you have myopic macular degeneration, increased risk glaucoma and cataracts.  When you use your computer you need to look away from the screen every 10-15 minutes, focus at the furthest thing you can see (out the window would be great) and blink you eyes firmly 10-12 times. This helps dry eyes and relieves strain on the ciliary body (focus muscle) that may increase your myopia. Also spending a hour or more per day outside is good for myopia (all the near focusing  for books, computers, iphones, video games, texting, etc is creating a world wide epidemic of myopia especially among Asians).

I had d&c on 21 May and my first af came in 1st of July. It has been induced by dr because based on u/s he saw that I am not going to have my af soon and he wanted me to have one soon so I can be on the way to ttc and also to flush out a bit of blood clot still left inside my uterus. He gaved me pills to consume for 10 days. After the 10 days, I have to wait another 5 days and my first af finally came. I have to have my blood tested as dr. suspected I have PCOS and will need to test my hormones level. I should be able to know the results by end of this week.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my first af arrived 1st July and only lasted for 3 days. It was heavy and crampy. Came to the third day, i was only spotting. So I am wondering is this normal? Has this happened to anyone b4? I know our bodies will be out of whack after m/c but there are still many questions in my mind. Does this counts as the first cycle? Will I ovulate? I am now back to having cm, and my bbt is lower than usual starting 3 days ago.\r\n\r\nThank you for answering my questions.

It has been induced by dr because based on u/s he saw that I am not going to have my af soon and he wanted me to have one soon so I can be on the way to ttc and also to flush out a bit of blood clot still left inside my uterus. He gaved me pills to consume for 10 days. After the 10 days, I have to wait another 5 days and my first af finally came. I have to have my blood tested as dr. suspected I have PCOS and will need to test my hormones level. I should be able to know the results by end of this week.    Anyway, my first af arrived 1st July and only lasted for 3 days. It was heavy and crampy. Came to the third day, i was only spotting. So I am wondering is this normal? Has this happened to anyone b4? I know our bodies will be out of whack after m/c but there are still many questions in my mind. Does this counts as the first cycle? Will I ovulate? I am now back to having cm, and my bbt is lower than usual starting 3 days ago.    Thank you for answering my questions. And I apologize if I have too many questions.    Grace.

At higher doses a bile-sequestering fiber compound (e.g., guar gum, pectin, psyllium, or oat bran) may be useful to prevent mucosal irritation and loose stools.  Allergic reactions are rare.    ....Most products available in the United States are standardized to contain 70-80% silymarin.  Products containing concentrated extract representing 35, 50, 140 mg of silymarin are available.  Doses of 70 to 200 mg 3x daily (based on silymarin content) have been used, with a dose of 140mg 3x/da most commonly described.

Now , since the surgery, have good distance  (20/30) but poor intermediate and terrible near vision. When I try to read, I only see bar codes, squiggles, not letters. Tried over the counter readers, and use 2.75 (probably could benefit from stronger ones, but that was highest the store had). Before the surgery, I had only a mild Rx for reading,and did not always bother with reading glasses. This was a big shock and very surprising, as restor was supposed to help with both distance and near vision, and near got much worse.  The surgeon says I have an opaque capsule  and that he could do a laser procedure, but I've had several opinions since, and was told that the capsule doesn't explain the problem with near vision, and it could help with acuity but only marginally, minimially,  with reading. Besides, it would make any future lens removal very difficult.    Here is a summary of  several opinions.  One MD says that my pupil does not contract for near vision, and recommended pilocarpine, 4x daily, 1% strength. I had immediate benefit, but after only 2 days of using it, woke up in the night with pain, tearing, red eye, swollen lid. He said I had allergic reaction, and suggests lower dosage with anti-inflammatory drops (prednisolone). I was actually taking prednisolone post-surgery, though at a low dosage  , until the day  before I started the pilocarpine, so I must had have  at least some protective effect of anti-inflammatory drops in my system,. Now it's almost 6 weeks later, since I took the pilocarpine and had the allergic reaction,  the redness etc. is gone, but I continue to have pain (sudden sharp pains, and pulsations/spasms). I am afraid to try pilocarpine again. He said sometimes you can take it for only 6 mo., and the pupil changes and contracts for reading; sometimes you need it indefinitely. Seems pretty powerful and scares me.   Also read of possible retinal detachment as side effect.  THis doctor also suggested replacing the lens with monofocal lens , but I can't understand the logic of that, if Restor is supposed to be the best choice for good near vision. He is considered a top doctor in NY, the Dr. FixIt that other doctors end problemic cases to!. I am now officially under his care. He also suggests a procedure to permanently contract the pupils if nothing else works. That seems far too drastic for me (pupilloplasty) and am afraid to such changes to my eye, and how that could effect both eyes, with one pupil smaller than the other.   I was never told had  ""large pupils ""  before (they don't look especially large or unusual) and never had any related problems with this before surgery?    Can the  cataract surgery change the way the pupil contracts? Did something go wrong during the surgery/? I had no complications after the surgery except problems with near/intermediate vision.Did I have a pre-=existing condition that i did n't know about? I've gotten no answers on this.    Another opinion said power of Restor lens was too weak, and recommends replacing lens with Restor at higher power.   But none of the other doctors mentioned anything about the lens being too weak (15.5D)     All of the doctors said that I would have trouble tolerating glasses/contacts, because there is a very wide divergence between the 2 eyes ( Ithink more than 5+ diopeters). .    The other eye also had a severe cataract which has gotten worse in the last year (the worsening of the cataracts in both eyes is what propelled me to have the surgery). I was supposed to have the 2nd eye done, but am postponing everything until it is clear what went wrong with the first surgery and what lens would be right.     Since the surgery, I use no glasses for distance, as my old glasses prescription  just blurs the eye that had the cataract removed.

I have been off them for about 4 months and I am still getting the dizzy spells like before so I am lost.  \r\n\r\nI can be having a good day and out of nowhere It hits me.  Usually it starts off with near black out and horrible dizziness.  Everything seems to be spinning and it's hard to see straight.  I feel like I am going to pass out.  I usually hold me head because I am extremely dizzy.  I feels like my head is moving out of control.  I get nausea and sweat but at the same time I get the chills.  It lasts for a few seconds and my vision comes back but I still have some  dizziness.  I get the chills for several hours after and I am so weak.  Sometimes it takes me days to recover and I just can't function having to stay in bed.  \r\n\r\nCan this be a panic attack?  I know people usually say that they feel like they are having a heart attack.  I don't feel like I am having a heart attack.  I do get realy scared when it happens.

Sometimes it takes me days to recover and I just can't function having to stay in bed.      Can this be a panic attack?  I know people usually say that they feel like they are having a heart attack.  I don't feel like I am having a heart attack.  I do get realy scared when it happens.  The last time it happened I was just shopping in a store and I got a really bad one.  I got really scared and I was so overwhelmed with the fear of loosing control of my body. Sometimes when it happens it is mild.      I am an anxious person and have a lot of stress.  I feel like this is debilitating my life.  I can't do the things I used to.  I used to love working out and now I just can't.  I am always feeling dizzy and I am afraid to set off another bad dizzy spell with everything else that follows.      I have seen a doctor several years ago for this.  I had a lot of tests and they all came back fine.  The doctor prescribed me antidepressants/anxiety meds and I could not tolerate the side effects so I just stopped taking them.  I also never went back to the doctor.    Does anyone else experience the near blackout?  Can I be getting a panic attack?

I got a degree in rehabilitation and sometimes the classes we take tend to inform you about all the bad diseases that can plague your body. I tend to worry about this a lot.

My PCP thought it was gallstones so he had an ultrasound of my abdomen ordered. \r\n\r\nIn turn the technician who completely violated his duties went on to tell me the results and that in fact I did NOT have gallstones but a swollen liver and that I should go to the doctor immediately. Mind you this was on a Saturday. I was frantic, afraid and uneasy. When I got to my doctor on Monday he told me it was just fatty liver.

My doctor said just to diet and all would be ok. \r\n\r\nThe hepatitis aspect of it frightens me horribly. I do have 3 small tattoos that I got in my college years. The last about 4 years ago. I began thinking maybe it was hepatitis. Since August and even before then my doctor has ran tons of blood tests. CBC, platelets, hepatic panel, etc. The rational mind would say they would have caught hepatitis by now but the anxious side of me says that maybe they missed something. Is this possible? Is it possible that they could have done sooooo many blood tests and missed hepatitis? If it was Hep C would I be showing symptoms already? (jaundice, etc) I am so worried.

That did the job also cause with neither protection did i once ever experienced any scares of being pregnant. My period came all exactly 28 days & very heavy, now I have been off birth control since 6/2013, & yes i have been trting to concieve but failed all this time, (i havent really been on top of my fertile or ovulation days). Since ive been off birth control my cycles have been pretty normal but kinda light at the beginning & heavy ay the end (which is normal for me). Now i still havent been tracking my fertile or ovulation days but there is a big chance i can get pregnant still even though i dont follow thru with my fertile days right? Can my excessive use of birth control play a part on why i havent got pregnant or is it just cause i dont pay attention to my ovulation or fertile days? I dont really understand..

EVEN THOUGH I KNOW they are benign...and as close as 2 weeks ago, my cardiologist, exasperated, tells me to just exercise through them, it will help them (and hes right...) during the day..at work...and now...at home...and at night when Im trying to watch tv..and when I go out to eat...and when I go to a movie..or for a walk...or or OR OR OR!!!! They are alllllllways with me. Not constantly....but irregularily regular. If that makes sense. Meaning...I can pretty much count on them coming daily...at SOME point, in my day, I will feel one or two \""BLIPS\""... and then suddenly, they are back, and going strong. The cardiac fitness tech WAS having me wear a monitor when I would come in with palps...but...even she has backed off on that now, because every time I come, im having them...and every time I wear the monitor, and she watches VERY closely....I get done, and she said...\""gosh...I see you are definatly having A whole lot of palpitations---BUT-----they are almost 99% PACs..a few PVCs...and they just arent anything that concerns me\""..........she said \""I give you credit for keeping on working out...if you can truly feel ALL of those..because there are alot\""......and I do feel every single one. \r\nTake today. Its a BEAUTIFUL day outside. THe first nice day weve had here in Wisconsin in ....well, a month? Its the first time weve been able to turn off the air conditioning and open the windows. Its GREAT.\r\nAnd where am I??? Im here..in the house, on the computer rambling to you all....\r\nI try ...to ignore them...I really really do. \r\nBut now, I will go downstairs to do the laundry...and when I come up...just doing those stairs, will set off another long set of them.\r\n\r\nit makes me want to give up.

I would get bloated and nauseous every time I ate.  I made an appt with a gastro doc who thought it was ulcers.
