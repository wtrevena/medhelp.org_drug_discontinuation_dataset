We went to UCLA for appt with research doctor, Dr. DeVos, there is only one more path for him to take that would be a mini bone marrow, same thing as a bone marrow just milder dosing.  Dr. Schiller, doctor who gave him stem cell transplant said that my husbands hodgkins is Chemo Resistant.  There is no chemo that will cure his hodgkins.  Said they will not offer my husband the mini bone marrow transplant because it will not work.  We asked how long does he have to live with the hodgkins coming back immediately after stem cell like it did.  They give my hubby 6 months to live.  He told me it is not good and very dismel for my husband.  So, now we are in the process of contacting a probate/living will attorney; making sure my name is on everything.  He has insurance coverage until June 2008, then if necessary we will switch to medicare and social security. We are trying to make things as simple as possible for me and the 2 boys once Hubby passes.  This is not an easy road to travel, the last few days he has had more pain, which tells me it is getting more aggressive.  They have him on a morphine patch (50mg) and he takes Vicodin as a break through pain killer.  I am hoping we can change the patch every 2 days instead of 3, he does not want to increase the mg. yet.  He told me he does not want to be that incapasitated this soon.  We will probably be getting intouch with Hospice to make arrangements for them down the way.  Hubby does not want to die in a hospital, he wants to die at home with Hospice care.  He now has a friend that is drilling him with holistic healing.  I do agree with the mind, body and spirit part.  But they want to hook him up to a doctor in Neveda for this.  These treatments have less that 50% success rate and with such little time left, I don';t want him to be spending his last days doing this tx and it not work, I keep thinking of what my kids will miss out on in his last days here.  I am very confused about this.  By the end of the 6 months he will be bed ridden, so that leaves a very small window of oppertunity for family time before this takes place.

I am very confused at this, so if anyone has any information pretaining to someone or something to this, please chime in.  \r\nThe kids know that this 3rd round of Hodgkins is not simple at all and that they may not be able to fix it this time; but they do not know they have given him a time table of 6 months.

It lasts for a few seconds and my vision comes back but I still have some  dizziness.  I get the chills for several hours after and I am so weak.  Sometimes it takes me days to recover and I just can't function having to stay in bed.      Can this be a panic attack?  I know people usually say that they feel like they are having a heart attack.  I don't feel like I am having a heart attack.  I do get realy scared when it happens.  The last time it happened I was just shopping in a store and I got a really bad one.  I got really scared and I was so overwhelmed with the fear of loosing control of my body. Sometimes when it happens it is mild.      I am an anxious person and have a lot of stress.  I feel like this is debilitating my life.  I can't do the things I used to.  I used to love working out and now I just can't.  I am always feeling dizzy and I am afraid to set off another bad dizzy spell with everything else that follows.      I have seen a doctor several years ago for this.  I had a lot of tests and they all came back fine.  The doctor prescribed me antidepressants/anxiety meds and I could not tolerate the side effects so I just stopped taking them.  I also never went back to the doctor.    Does anyone else experience the near blackout?  Can I be getting a panic attack?

Anways, in January of this year I started my period one week before I should have (third week of active pills),  and then the next week when I should have started I quit. I went to the doctor in February for my yearly exam and she gave me a pregnancy test, which was negative and said not to worry about it, it was probably just a one month thing.  Well after that everything was fine until last month. Last month I started my period a week early again. This time however, it was a regular flow and it lasted like that for two straight weeks (through the third week active pills and the placebo pills).  After I started a new pack of pills my period stopped but this entire month I have been a complete hormonal mess. I have had crazy moodswings - crying alot or getting angry easily (which is VERY unlike me), I have had trouble sleeping (also very unlike me), trouble concentrating, naseau, etc.  Anyways I was starting to worry that I may be pregnant so I took a test even though I had not missed my period, of course it came back negative. Well last week (one week before my period) I woke up and had horrible cramps in my stomach and lower back. I began spotting dark brown, the next day it was mixed with blood and by the third day I was bleeding very heavily and having the worst cramps that I have ever had since before birth control, it felt alot like something scratching the inside of my lower abdomen (and my breast hurt as well, which I rarely get before or during my period).  Yesterday was the day that I SHOULD have started my period and when I woke up yesterday most of the cramps were gone (including the sore breasts) and I was once again just barely spotting dark brown.  Today, almost nothing at all.   Has anyone else had this happen? I have an appt next week, I was thinking that the birthcontrol after all these years just isn't right for me anymore. I was thinking about just getting off completely, because I would like to have a child in the next couple of years.  However, I am kind of scared because I hope my periods won't be like this every month!  I'm sorry this is so long, I guess my question is has anyone else experienced this and what was it?

I fall asleep for some time (usually 30-45 min) and wake up again throughout the rest of the night. In the morning I am exhausted and cannot perform at work. Changing diet does not help much. I do not have symptoms if i do not eat at all during the day, BUT even if I do not eat at bedtime I will have the above mentioned distress throughout the night.   My blood tests show that I am healthy. My stool varies from day to day: it can be normal, or dehydrated, or loose (diarrhea type), or spasmodic.   Does anybody know what it is I have?   Do I have to live on anti-gas pills for the rest of my life?     Please help  Thanks  ""","[{""q1a"":{""no"":false,""yes"":true},""q1b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":true},""q2a"":{""q2a1"":false,""q2a2"":false,""q2a3"":true,""q2a4"":false,""q2a5"":true,""q2a6"":false,""q2a7"":false,""q2a8"":false},""q2b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":true}}]"

It's also true that if you had gotten tested the next day you might have come out normal -- only repeated tests over time can produce an accurate picture, as we change from day to day and hour to hour.  What is also possible that this supplement, or, given you don't seem to be as particular about what you ingest as some, you might be eating some other food or taking an herb that is tainted.  But again, whenever you suspect a supplement is a problem, stop taking it and see if it solves the problem.""","[{""q1a"":{""no"":false,""yes"":true},""q1b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":true},""q2a"":{""q2a1"":false,""q2a2"":true,""q2a3"":false,""q2a4"":false,""q2a5"":false,""q2a6"":false,""q2a7"":false,""q2a8"":false},""q2b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":true,""very_confident"":false}}]"

He said I had allergic reaction, and suggests lower dosage with anti-inflammatory drops (prednisolone).

Now it's almost 6 weeks later, since I took the pilocarpine and had the allergic reaction,  the redness etc. is gone, but I continue to have pain (sudden sharp pains, and pulsations/spasms).

Also read of possible retinal detachment as side effect.\r\nTHis doctor also suggested replacing the lens with monofocal lens , but I can't understand the logic of that, if Restor is supposed to be the best choice for good near vision. He is considered a top doctor in NY, the Dr. FixIt that other doctors end problemic cases to!. I am now officially under his care. He also suggests a procedure to permanently contract the pupils if nothing else works. That seems far too drastic for me (pupilloplasty) and am afraid to such changes to my eye, and how that could effect both eyes, with one pupil smaller than the other. \r\nI was never told had \""large pupils\""  before (they don't look especially large or unusual) and never had any related problems with this before surgery?\r\n\r\nCan the  cataract surgery change the way the pupil contracts?

I read with the other eye, the one with the cataract, sometimes using my glasses, sometimes not.

Another opinion said power of Restor lens was too weak, and recommends replacing lens with Restor at higher power.   But none of the other doctors mentioned anything about the lens being too weak (15.5D)     All of the doctors said that I would have trouble tolerating glasses/contacts, because there is a very wide divergence between the 2 eyes ( Ithink more than 5+ diopeters). .    The other eye also had a severe cataract which has gotten worse in the last year (the worsening of the cataracts in both eyes is what propelled me to have the surgery). I was supposed to have the 2nd eye done, but am postponing everything until it is clear what went wrong with the first surgery and what lens would be right.     Since the surgery, I use no glasses for distance, as my old glasses prescription  just blurs the eye that had the cataract removed. I read with the other eye, the one with the cataract, sometimes using my glasses, sometimes not. As with  the eye that  had the cataract, both eyes always enabled me to read comfortably, with mild Rx for reading or without reading glasses. I also sometimes try the over the counter reader for the eye that has the Restor lens, but  probably need a stronger one than I have-- but it helps..I use the reader for the computer. Obviously, using either of these glasses for reading only helps one eye, and the other is blurred as it is not the right Rx for the other eye..  Also  was told the many drops I've been taking since surgery had made my eye dry, so now I have been taking Systane.  I also tried Refresh, didn't seem very different from Systane. anyone with esperiences with these drops? Do you have to take them forever?    I am very frightened now of any more procedures-  such as replacing the lens (because I now have had  different suggestions as to what kind of lens with different MDs). The results of the surgery were unexpected, as I don't know if a replacement would help, or possibly create new, unexpected problems.    I am also afraid of doing the 2nd eye, as at least now I am assured that I can read with that eye. It frightens me to think that my natural reading ability could be decreased again.

""","""I have had an odd assortment of symptoms for several months to possibly a year or so that are scary, and at times debilitating. I had an ACD&F done 7 months ago, there is a small goiter on my thyroid (but I apparently have levels within normal range) and I have Essure implants. I had a 2 day long heart work up with Holter monitor that showed very slight regurgitation. I have had a low grade fever of 99.2-99.9 for several months. I just found out by accident that I have a 4-5mm synovial cyst in my lumbar vertebrae and another lower about 2-3mm. I feel somewhat lethargic and weak, but intermittently. I have  ""episodes "" where I am feeling great, then my vision will fade to grayish, one arm feels weak and numb and I get dizzy and have  pretty consistant and sometimes severe stabbing pain in a localized spot on my chest (same side as affected arm ).

He was supposed to lie completely flat for a week in the hospital, but because he was an addict, they wouldn't sedate him enough to do this without incident.  The withdraw symptoms made his spleen injury worse, and he left the hospital's ICU against medical advice.    The following day, he went to a different hospital.  By this time, he needed 4 units of blood and surgery to stop internal bleeding.  They kept him sedated for 3 days in ICU, but as soon as they started weaning him off of the medication, his withdraw symptoms were back and he left AMA again. I don't understand why, but the hospitals in our area do not provide detox services, even in the most critical cases.     For the past 2 days, he's been living out of his car.  Tonight's the season's first frost, so I'm especially worried and upset.  I missed a call from him about an hour ago -- his voicemail is begging for a warm bed.      Should I keep the position that we've all agreed to take about not letting him stay with us?  Thanks for any advice you can offer.""","[{""q1a"":{""no"":false,""yes"":true},""q1b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":true},""q2a"":{""q2a1"":false,""q2a2"":false,""q2a3"":false,""q2a4"":true,""q2a5"":false,""q2a6"":false,""q2a7"":false,""q2a8"":true},""q2b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":true,""very_confident"":false}}]"

One thing that is perplexing to me is why it keep coming back after 2 courses of Nystatin. ""","""My story is perplexing and has been unsettling at times. Currently, I am 28 years old and also happen to be a medical student in the U.S. I was never promiscuous but had a lapse in judgment 7 years ago..... Yes 7 years ago is correct. I slept with a female during undergrad and had unprotected oral and vaginal intercourse. 2 weeks later I had severe pain after ejaculation and on the 3rd week I was severely sick for a few weeks and a sore throat lasting a few months.     I asked the girl to be tested but she was afraid and said she was fine. Granted this left  ""what ifs in my mind "". It also lead me down the same rabbit hole many of you are currently going through. By this I'm referring to having a plethora of HIV tests. To name a few of the ~40 I have taken over 7 years:     RNA Viral Load quantitation ~10 weeks past the exposure . = undetectable   DNA PCR Proviral ~ 1 year, 3, years, and 5 years past = not detected   2 different RNA PCR Qualitative (FDA approved) = not detected.   To many Oraquick Advance Rapid oral swabs to keep track of = all Negative   Several ELISA, ICMA, and EIAs typically through lab corp.   Then a few months ago I had a Negative P24 rapid antigen test at a local hospital. = negative     Have I been thinking about this non-stop? Nope, Ive actually had several amazing years after this which is how I was able to get things back on track and come to medical school. However; symptoms (which everyone will say means nothing) have lead me back to this. I was actually forgetting all about this in terms of thinking there was a possibility of having this condition, Until a few months ago when I had 2 wisdom teeth extracted.     A few weeks after this I started to get severe burning in my mouth, a metallic taste, and dry mouth. I would almost describe it as a  ""Menthol "" like sensation. I looked in the mirror and on the lateral aspect of my tongue there was a localized white patch. My university health clinic prescribed me Nystatin swish and swallow which relieved the pain after several days on it and the lesion went away. However, it will go away and then reappear after a few days. I can always tell when its about to come because burning nearly always precedes it.     I have an appointment with an ENT tomorrow morning, and an infectious disease specialist on Tuesday. Im trying to convince myself that this is because of the 4 day course of Penicillin VK I was on 500mg, 4 times a day .... this is actually when this started. Im hoping it was the cause and not just a coincidence that I happened to be taking them.     I took another rapid HIV test yesterday and it was still negative thankfully.     Also, I tell myself this as FINALLY after 7 years, I wrote the girl this happened with and needless to say she was not happy with me but finally said she was tested for HIV when she had her 2 children.

It doesn't hurt when I urinate but if I try to go when I don't really need to then I'm in agony and end up having a small amount of urine which has blood in it. The only way to stop the feeling of needing to urinate is by drink lots, but then I do actually need to go. As soon as I empty my bladder the pain starts all over again. It's a never ending circle! I've been to the doctors several times and each time given antibiotics which clear it till next month. I've been to a urologist who did a cystoscopy and the results showed the lining of my bladder was slightly inflamed but he said this was probably from a previous infection! Since then i've given up and I don't know what to do. I haven't got time to go to the doctors each month and worse still I don't want to be taking antibiotics constantly.
