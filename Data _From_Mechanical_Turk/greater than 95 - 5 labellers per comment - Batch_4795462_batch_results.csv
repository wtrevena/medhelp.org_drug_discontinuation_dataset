Right Atrial Enlargement  QRS duration 92 ms                    Rightward Axis  QT/QTc 312/400 ms                    Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block  P-R-T axes 80 97 62                    Abnormal ECG (? Why?)    Any input would be great. They have already done a holter and all I know from it is that my beats ranged from 50-179 beats per minute. I have already been tested for blood pressure, blood sugar, thyroid, etc. so I am wondering why they are sending me to a cardiologist. Thank you and I will keep you all in my prayers.""","[{""q1a"":{""no"":true,""yes"":false},""q1b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":true}}]"

You should also read about amsler grid testing, print one out, put it on your refrigerator and look at it daily one eye at a time. That is because lacquer cracks and myopic macular degeneration can cause  ""wet "" (exudative) macular degeneration. With any sudden change in vision or amsler grid you need to see one of your two ophthalmologists IMMEDIATELY.   Also live a healthy lifestyle:  don't smoke, eat great diet, if you use alcohol us in moderation, watch your weight, gentle exercise like walking or swimming,  be checked annually for hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol.  Avoid high impact activities like contact sports and amusement park rides, don't do head down yoga.  Enjoy your nursing career my mother and two of my aunts were RNs that's how I got into medicine.

I have been off them for about 4 months and I am still getting the dizzy spells like before so I am lost.  \r\n\r\nI can be having a good day and out of nowhere It hits me.  Usually it starts off with near black out and horrible dizziness.  Everything seems to be spinning and it's hard to see straight.  I feel like I am going to pass out.  I usually hold me head because I am extremely dizzy.  I feels like my head is moving out of control.  I get nausea and sweat but at the same time I get the chills.  It lasts for a few seconds and my vision comes back but I still have some  dizziness.  I get the chills for several hours after and I am so weak.  Sometimes it takes me days to recover and I just can't function having to stay in bed.  \r\n\r\nCan this be a panic attack?  I know people usually say that they feel like they are having a heart attack.  I don't feel like I am having a heart attack.  I do get realy scared when it happens.  The last time it happened I was just shopping in a store and I got a really bad one.  I got really scared and I was so overwhelmed with the fear of loosing control of my body. Sometimes when it happens it is mild.  \r\n\r\nI am an anxious person and have a lot of stress.  I feel like this is debilitating my life.  I can't do the things I used to.

I am always feeling dizzy and I am afraid to set off another bad dizzy spell with everything else that follows.  \r\n\r\nI have seen a doctor several years ago for this.  I had a lot of tests and they all came back fine.  The doctor prescribed me antidepressants/anxiety meds and I could not tolerate the side effects so I just stopped taking them.

I usually hold me head because I am extremely dizzy.  I feels like my head is moving out of control.  I get nausea and sweat but at the same time I get the chills.

I've never been so MANIC in my life!!  This past year and a half has been hell trying to stabilize my moods. I've tried Lithuim and Abilify too and still it hasn't helped. So, I'm back on Depakote.    When they upped to dose of Remeron from 30mg to 45mg, because  they said I seemed more down and depressed.  I slipped into the most manic phase of my life. I got even more depressed and started sleeping 13 hours a day!   I was so up and down and irritable and hated the world.  I'm usually not that angry or emotional.  Then once I came back down to 30 mg of Remeron I was much much better.  \r\n\r\nI honesty don't know if its the Remeron that has made me seem bi-polar or if I truly am.

It's a start.  Scarlet37 it seems you understand what this experience means.  I have sometimes wondered about narcolepsy, as I can fall asleep very rapidly on buses etc.  Currently I take a lot of pain medication, and blame it on that, but the reality is I've always had a tendency to drop off to sleep if my environment becomes too unstimulating.  I went through a stage of some years where the paralysis was rare, and now it has returned so severely I broke my silence and told the neurologist I was seeing.  Every episode has me convinced I will never move again, or die from suffocation.  No technique gets me out of the state, I can freely step in and out of lucid dreams in the state and use these dreams to try to scare myslef awake eg. bashing myself hard - I actually physically feel the impact and pain.  Then when the dream doesn't work and I am still going seconds at a time choking for air I stop the dream and just lie there waiting and willing it all to end.  Often prior to an attack I will get a sudden and almost desperate sleepiness, not like normal tiredness.  I know it will lead to an attack but the urge to sleep is overwhelming.  I don't know, maybe it is a mild sort of narcolepsy.  Seems my nervous system is generally going bonkers over recent years.  Finally have a neurologist who is taking me seriously.  I still have the thought in my mind that so many of my problems indicate some systemic autoimmune problem, but the blood tests always come up negative for the relevant antibodies.  So many things are deteriorating all at once now, including the sleep problem.  I'm only in my early forties and was a fitness fanatic before.  Now I hobble around with a walking stick and a stack of morphine to get me through the day.  I just don't see how the sleep disorder can be unrelated.  Just moaning.  I know what a horrible condition narcolepsy is, and I am sorry you have it.  I hope you have it under control.  Seems my latest problem this week is insomnia, this is the third night in a row I've been up all night.  Starting work again in a matter of months, if I am fit, need to learn to go to bed at normal times!  Keep well.  Please let me know if you hear of any great new research.

Sometimes it would wake me up in the middle of the night with a searing pain usually in the lower left side of the abdomen (LLQ). This would happen chronically.

Blood will still flow through dead areas of tissue and the scan would never know the tissue was in fact dead. A nuclear viability scan on the other hand works in a different way. First a scan is done using radioactive ammonia to show up the blood vessels, much in the same way as the perfusion scan. Then a radioactive glucose is injected which is metabolised by the cells in the body, including heart cells. After enough time has elapsed for the metabolism to establish, another scan is taken which shows the areas of tissue that have absorbed the glucose. This scan takes just over an hour.\r\nHave I got this wrong?

No sooner than I finished tx, my husband was diagnoise with re-curring Hodgkins.  \r\n\r\nWell the stem cell transfusion did not work at all.  We went to UCLA for appt with research doctor, Dr. DeVos, there is only one more path for him to take that would be a mini bone marrow, same thing as a bone marrow just milder dosing.  Dr. Schiller, doctor who gave him stem cell transplant said that my husbands hodgkins is Chemo Resistant.  There is no chemo that will cure his hodgkins.  Said they will not offer my husband the mini bone marrow transplant because it will not work.  We asked how long does he have to live with the hodgkins coming back immediately after stem cell like it did.  They give my hubby 6 months to live.  He told me it is not good and very dismel for my husband.  So, now we are in the process of contacting a probate/living will attorney; making sure my name is on everything.  He has insurance coverage until June 2008, then if necessary we will switch to medicare and social security. We are trying to make things as simple as possible for me and the 2 boys once Hubby passes.  This is not an easy road to travel, the last few days he has had more pain, which tells me it is getting more aggressive.  They have him on a morphine patch (50mg) and he takes Vicodin as a break through pain killer.  I am hoping we can change the patch every 2 days instead of 3, he does not want to increase the mg. yet.  He told me he does not want to be that incapasitated this soon.  We will probably be getting intouch with Hospice to make arrangements for them down the way.  Hubby does not want to die in a hospital, he wants to die at home with Hospice care.  He now has a friend that is drilling him with holistic healing.  I do agree with the mind, body and spirit part.  But they want to hook him up to a doctor in Neveda for this.  These treatments have less that 50% success rate and with such little time left, I don';t want him to be spending his last days doing this tx and it not work, I keep thinking of what my kids will miss out on in his last days here.  I am very confused about this.  By the end of the 6 months he will be bed ridden, so that leaves a very small window of oppertunity for family time before this takes place.  The one tx they want him to start is PAW PAW/alternative chemo.  I am very confused at this, so if anyone has any information pretaining to someone or something to this, please chime in.  \r\nThe kids know that this 3rd round of Hodgkins is not simple at all and that they may not be able to fix it this time; but they do not know they have given him a time table of 6 months.  Don't know if I am going to tell them, they already know that it's bad and he may not succeed this time, but don't know it can be as soon as 6 months.\r\nWell all I can do is go day for day and pray he will not be in pain and will be kept comfortable through out his time.\r\nTime for me to leave work for the day now.

I would almost describe it as a \""Menthol\"" like sensation. I looked in the mirror and on the lateral aspect of my tongue there was a localized white patch. My university health clinic prescribed me Nystatin swish and swallow which relieved the pain after several days on it and the lesion went away. However, it will go away and then reappear after a few days. I can always tell when its about to come because burning nearly always precedes it. \r\n\r\nI have an appointment with an ENT tomorrow morning, and an infectious disease specialist on Tuesday. Im trying to convince myself that this is because of the 4 day course of Penicillin VK I was on 500mg, 4 times a day .... this is actually when this started. Im hoping it was the cause and not just a coincidence that I happened to be taking them. \r\n\r\nI took another rapid HIV test yesterday and it was still negative thankfully. \r\n\r\nAlso, I tell myself this as FINALLY after 7 years, I wrote the girl this happened with and needless to say she was not happy with me but finally said she was tested for HIV when she had her 2 children. \r\n\r\nI would literally have to be the most unlucky person if this was to turn up after all these years.

To name a few of the ~40 I have taken over 7 years:     RNA Viral Load quantitation ~10 weeks past the exposure . = undetectable   DNA PCR Proviral ~ 1 year, 3, years, and 5 years past = not detected   2 different RNA PCR Qualitative (FDA approved) = not detected.   To many Oraquick Advance Rapid oral swabs to keep track of = all Negative   Several ELISA, ICMA, and EIAs typically through lab corp.   Then a few months ago I had a Negative P24 rapid antigen test at a local hospital. = negative     Have I been thinking about this non-stop? Nope, Ive actually had several amazing years after this which is how I was able to get things back on track and come to medical school. However; symptoms (which everyone will say means nothing) have lead me back to this. I was actually forgetting all about this in terms of thinking there was a possibility of having this condition, Until a few months ago when I had 2 wisdom teeth extracted.     A few weeks after this I started to get severe burning in my mouth, a metallic taste, and dry mouth. I would almost describe it as a  ""Menthol "" like sensation. I looked in the mirror and on the lateral aspect of my tongue there was a localized white patch. My university health clinic prescribed me Nystatin swish and swallow which relieved the pain after several days on it and the lesion went away. However, it will go away and then reappear after a few days. I can always tell when its about to come because burning nearly always precedes it.     I have an appointment with an ENT tomorrow morning, and an infectious disease specialist on Tuesday. Im trying to convince myself that this is because of the 4 day course of Penicillin VK I was on 500mg, 4 times a day .... this is actually when this started. Im hoping it was the cause and not just a coincidence that I happened to be taking them.     I took another rapid HIV test yesterday and it was still negative thankfully.     Also, I tell myself this as FINALLY after 7 years, I wrote the girl this happened with and needless to say she was not happy with me but finally said she was tested for HIV when she had her 2 children.     I would literally have to be the most unlucky person if this was to turn up after all these years. One thing that is perplexing to me is why it keep coming back after 2 courses of Nystatin.

There is a possibility that they are still low. Your iron level dropping is definitely a cause of concern! There are a few things which come to my mind.

Her short term memory is terrible.  She doesn't remember something that happened yesterday until I remind her of almost all the details, and sometimes she remembers things differently, forgetting important details forever.  I don't mean this in a judgmental way - but she has become very insensitive to other adults around her.  Emotionally insensitive, like others are not supposed to have any feelings at all, while hers on the other hand are important.  She sleeps 12 hours a day and still takes naps.  No energy.  No libido. Her facial expressions show strongly feelings of anger, disapproval, etc., but she denies them, and tells me and the rest of her family to ignore the feelings we're \""supposedly\"" seeing play across her face that she is unaware of.  Her answer to anyone who challenges her about anything is \""just don't worry about it\"", or \""that's just the way I am\"".  We both have been through extensive therapy for child abuse issues, yet she seems to have forgotten everything she learned in therapy.  Dealing with her is often very confusing, as her arguments follow no logical pattern (don't follow some of the usual rules of logic and discussion).  It's a lot like dealing with a drunk person, without the slurring of words.\r\n     I have tried to show her information about side effects, studies, etc. to no avail.  Because Zoloft is not illegal or socially unacceptable, her denial seems as big or bigger than I have seen in active addicts of alcohol and other drugs.  I never badger her, of course.  I don't bring it up anymore, because she refuses to acknowledge any of what I'm saying here. I am very careful to stay present and nonthreatening in almost all my interactions with her.  I'm not perfect at it, but do pretty well, because if I don't her reactions are exaggerated.\r\n     Any suggestions about how to handle all this, other than the standard intervention?""","""     My wife has been on Zoloft since before we met in 1998.

Anways, in January of this year I started my period one week before I should have (third week of active pills),  and then the next week when I should have started I quit. I went to the doctor in February for my yearly exam and she gave me a pregnancy test, which was negative and said not to worry about it, it was probably just a one month thing.  Well after that everything was fine until last month. Last month I started my period a week early again. This time however, it was a regular flow and it lasted like that for two straight weeks (through the third week active pills and the placebo pills).  After I started a new pack of pills my period stopped but this entire month I have been a complete hormonal mess. I have had crazy moodswings - crying alot or getting angry easily (which is VERY unlike me), I have had trouble sleeping (also very unlike me), trouble concentrating, naseau, etc.  Anyways I was starting to worry that I may be pregnant so I took a test even though I had not missed my period, of course it came back negative. Well last week (one week before my period) I woke up and had horrible cramps in my stomach and lower back. I began spotting dark brown, the next day it was mixed with blood and by the third day I was bleeding very heavily and having the worst cramps that I have ever had since before birth control, it felt alot like something scratching the inside of my lower abdomen (and my breast hurt as well, which I rarely get before or during my period).  Yesterday was the day that I SHOULD have started my period and when I woke up yesterday most of the cramps were gone (including the sore breasts) and I was once again just barely spotting dark brown.  Today, almost nothing at all.   Has anyone else had this happen? I have an appt next week, I was thinking that the birthcontrol after all these years just isn't right for me anymore. I was thinking about just getting off completely, because I would like to have a child in the next couple of years.  However, I am kind of scared because I hope my periods won't be like this every month!  I'm sorry this is so long, I guess my question is has anyone else experienced this and what was it?

I went to the doctor in February for my yearly exam and she gave me a pregnancy test, which was negative and said not to worry about it, it was probably just a one month thing.

After I started a new pack of pills my period stopped but this entire month I have been a complete hormonal mess. I have had crazy moodswings - crying alot or getting angry easily (which is VERY unlike me), I have had trouble sleeping (also very unlike me), trouble concentrating, naseau, etc.  Anyways I was starting to worry that I may be pregnant so I took a test even though I had not missed my period, of course it came back negative. Well last week (one week before my period) I woke up and had horrible cramps in my stomach and lower back. I began spotting dark brown, the next day it was mixed with blood and by the third day I was bleeding very heavily and having the worst cramps that I have ever had since before birth control, it felt alot like something scratching the inside of my lower abdomen (and my breast hurt as well, which I rarely get before or during my period).

I was thinking about just getting off completely, because I would like to have a child in the next couple of years.

I've been to a urologist who did a cystoscopy and the results showed the lining of my bladder was slightly inflamed but he said this was probably from a previous infection! Since then i've given up and I don't know what to do. I haven't got time to go to the doctors each month and worse still I don't want to be taking antibiotics constantly. Any advice greatly appreciated. I already do every thing recommended in the prevention of infections i.e. cranberry tablets and drink plenty of water.

Viruses such as HBV can persist by depositing their genetic information (DNA) in the cell nucleus, where the DNA is normally not degraded. This prevents antiviral drugs from eliminating these viruses. But the newly discovered mechanism could make this possible without damaging the infected cell in the liver. In the current issue of the prestigious journal Science, the scientists report that now new therapeutic possibilities are consequently opening up.    Although preventive vaccination is possible, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that more than 240 million people around the world are currently suffering from a chronic hepatitis B infection. They face a high risk of developing liver cirrhosis or even liver cancer. In Germany alone, more than half a million people are affected. Although available antiviral medicines can control the hepatitis B virus, they cannot completely eliminate it. As a result, the HBV in the patient's liver is reactivated as soon as the treatment is discontinued.    This is due to virus DNA (cccDNA: covalently closed circular DNA)  ""hidden "" in the cell nucleus. This virus DNA stores multiple copies of the virus in the nucleus of infected liver cells (hepatocytes) and in this way protects itself from destructive influences. The cccDNA serves as a template for the virus' own proteins and new viral genomes. An international team of scientists headed by Prof. Ulrike Protzer and Prof. Mathias Heikenw\u00e4lder, Institute of Virology at the Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen and the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, has now found a way to selectively attack and eliminate the viral genetic information in the cell nucleus of the liver cells without damaging the host cell in the process.     ""The degradation of viral DNA in the cell nucleus that we describe represents an important mechanism in the defence against the virus "", Protzer reports.  ""Moreover, for the first time, the results offer the possibility to develop a treatment that can heal hepatitis B.

I'm neither in the welfare system (never was as a child), nor do I have children; I actually worked for the government and only 27 years old. Yet, when I walk into a doctor's office, they assume so much of me. One doctor just sighed and asked how many children do I have without looking at my chart. Another just assumed it was high blood pressure or drugs, and so on. These are doctors of all races and backgrounds, so I don't think it's racism, but letting bad experiences with a certain group dictate their judgement of others. Due to this, no one actually tries to diagnose me, and this has been going on for a month.    On Monday Aug 20th, I started having diarrhea and vomiting; thankfully, it's subsiding.    For a while before this, my limbs are tingling, especially my toes. My throat feels a little tight. Muscle spasms. lightheartedness, dizziness, face is hot (no fever), fatigue, and my head feels tight.    I've been told I may have dehydration, then I was told I have a sinus infection. When I started vomiting and diarrhea, the last doctor I've seen told me who ever diagnosed me was an idiot, that Amoxicillin (for the sinus infection) was causing my diarrhea and said nothing is wrong with me; then told me to take nausea pills for whatever bug I caught and sent me on my way. I told him I haven't started taking it yet, and that this was caused by something else unknown to me. He got a little upset and asked why I didn't take the pills to begin with. I explained to him my work would be difficult if I have to use the restroom multiple times, so I was waiting for my day off (Tuesday, Aug 21), so I can fully observe myself due to never taking this drug before; he scuffed.     I just so tired. I hate that the way I look or my age makes me seem less of a person when I try so hard. I know I'm sick with something, I just don't know what, and no one seems to care until I'm knocking on deaths door. Anyway, I guess I'm looking for anything helpful to lift my spirits; not a diagnosis, because that's impossible over the web with my symptoms; but just real doctor advice from someone who enjoys their profession.

Here are some numbers to compare:                   11/22/06       4/5/07         4/13/07  Hemoglobin     15.2            14.0           13.2 G/DL  ALT            85              38  U/L  AST            51              24  U/L  WBC            6.74            5.7             6.9 K/CUMM  RBC            4.55            4.44            4.07 M/CUMM    Are there any other numbers that are important from the CBC test?  I can post them if needed.  I do my 3rd CBC test April 20 for further comparison.  I feel very run down and thought maybe I am heading toward being anemic and want to make sure I am monitoring the numbers correctly.  I am genotype 2b and my starting VL is 2,380,000 and I weigh 124 lbs. I am taking 0.4 ML weekly shots of the Peginterferon alfa-2b Redipen shot and am taking 400 mg. of Ribavirin approximately every 12 hours.  Thanks for your input!

I've noticed a lot of people on here take much more than I do, perhaps I should do that?    Also, I take it in liquid form (drops) which I add into my breakfast and my dinner (3,000iu each).

And this whole time being on the depo i have not bled except for the first two weeks, And all those symptoms well i was confused whether it could be the shot or what, i stopped taking the antibiotics for awhile now, and im supposed to go back for a new depo shot october 30th since mine is almost done with.    can anybody help me with my concerns...""","[{""q1a"":{""no"":false,""yes"":true},""q1b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":true},""q2a"":{""q2a1"":false,""q2a2"":false,""q2a3"":true,""q2a4"":false,""q2a5"":false,""q2a6"":false,""q2a7"":false,""q2a8"":false},""q2b"":{""not_confident"":false,""somewhat_confident"":false,""very_confident"":true}}]"

Now , since the surgery, have good distance  (20/30) but poor intermediate and terrible near vision. When I try to read, I only see bar codes, squiggles, not letters. Tried over the counter readers, and use 2.75 (probably could benefit from stronger ones, but that was highest the store had). Before the surgery, I had only a mild Rx for reading,and did not always bother with reading glasses. This was a big shock and very surprising, as restor was supposed to help with both distance and near vision, and near got much worse.\r\nThe surgeon says I have an opaque capsule  and that he could do a laser procedure, but I've had several opinions since, and was told that the capsule doesn't explain the problem with near vision, and it could help with acuity but only marginally, minimially,  with reading. Besides, it would make any future lens removal very difficult.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of  several opinions.\r\nOne MD says that my pupil does not contract for near vision, and recommended pilocarpine, 4x daily, 1% strength. I had immediate benefit, but after only 2 days of using it, woke up in the night with pain, tearing, red eye, swollen lid. He said I had allergic reaction, and suggests lower dosage with anti-inflammatory drops (prednisolone). I was actually taking prednisolone post-surgery, though at a low dosage  , until the day  before I started the pilocarpine, so I must had have  at least some protective effect of anti-inflammatory drops in my system,. Now it's almost 6 weeks later, since I took the pilocarpine and had the allergic reaction,  the redness etc. is gone, but I continue to have pain (sudden sharp pains, and pulsations/spasms). I am afraid to try pilocarpine again. He said sometimes you can take it for only 6 mo., and the pupil changes and contracts for reading; sometimes you need it indefinitely. Seems pretty powerful and scares me.   Also read of possible retinal detachment as side effect.\r\nTHis doctor also suggested replacing the lens with monofocal lens , but I can't understand the logic of that, if Restor is supposed to be the best choice for good near vision. He is considered a top doctor in NY, the Dr. FixIt that other doctors end problemic cases to!. I am now officially under his care. He also suggests a procedure to permanently contract the pupils if nothing else works. That seems far too drastic for me (pupilloplasty) and am afraid to such changes to my eye, and how that could effect both eyes, with one pupil smaller than the other. \r\nI was never told had \""large pupils\""  before (they don't look especially large or unusual) and never had any related problems with this before surgery?\r\n\r\nCan the  cataract surgery change the way the pupil contracts? Did something go wrong during the surgery/? I had no complications after the surgery except problems with near/intermediate vision.Did I have a pre-=existing condition that i did n't know about? I've gotten no answers on this.\r\n\r\nAnother opinion said power of Restor lens was too weak, and recommends replacing lens with Restor at higher power. \r\nBut none of the other doctors mentioned anything about the lens being too weak (15.5D)\r\n\r\n All of the doctors said that I would have trouble tolerating glasses/contacts, because there is a very wide divergence between the 2 eyes ( Ithink more than 5+ diopeters). .\r\n\r\nThe other eye also had a severe cataract which has gotten worse in the last year (the worsening of the cataracts in both eyes is what propelled me to have the surgery). I was supposed to have the 2nd eye done, but am postponing everything until it is clear what went wrong with the first surgery and what lens would be right. \r\n\r\nSince the surgery, I use no glasses for distance, as my old glasses prescription  just blurs the eye that had the cataract removed. I read with the other eye, the one with the cataract, sometimes using my glasses, sometimes not. As with  the eye that  had the cataract, both eyes always enabled me to read comfortably, with mild Rx for reading or without reading glasses. I also sometimes try the over the counter reader for the eye that has the Restor lens, but  probably need a stronger one than I have-- but it helps..I use the reader for the computer. Obviously, using either of these glasses for reading only helps one eye, and the other is blurred as it is not the right Rx for the other eye..\r\nAlso  was told the many drops I've been taking since surgery had made my eye dry, so now I have been taking Systane.  I also tried Refresh, didn't seem very different from Systane. anyone with esperiences with these drops? Do you have to take them forever?\r\n\r\nI am very frightened now of any more procedures-  such as replacing the lens (because I now have had  different suggestions as to what kind of lens with different MDs). The results of the surgery were unexpected, as I don't know if a replacement would help, or possibly create new, unexpected problems.\r\n\r\nI am also afraid of doing the 2nd eye, as at least now I am assured that I can read with that eye. It frightens me to think that my natural reading ability could be decreased again. I am a voracious reader and a reading teacher!\r\n\r\nAnyone had similar problems-- with Restor and near vision?\r\nWith pupil contraction? Mydriais?\r\nPupilloplasty?\r\nPilocarpine?\r\nAbility to tolerate glasses or contacts with a wide diopeter divergence?""","""I had Restor implant 9/9/09. in R eye for cataract.

Before the surgery, I had only a mild Rx for reading,and did not always bother with reading glasses. This was a big shock and very surprising, as restor was supposed to help with both distance and near vision, and near got much worse.  The surgeon says I have an opaque capsule  and that he could do a laser procedure, but I've had several opinions since, and was told that the capsule doesn't explain the problem with near vision, and it could help with acuity but only marginally, minimially,  with reading. Besides, it would make any future lens removal very difficult.    Here is a summary of  several opinions.  One MD says that my pupil does not contract for near vision, and recommended pilocarpine, 4x daily, 1% strength. I had immediate benefit, but after only 2 days of using it, woke up in the night with pain, tearing, red eye, swollen lid. He said I had allergic reaction, and suggests lower dosage with anti-inflammatory drops (prednisolone). I was actually taking prednisolone post-surgery, though at a low dosage  , until the day  before I started the pilocarpine, so I must had have  at least some protective effect of anti-inflammatory drops in my system,. Now it's almost 6 weeks later, since I took the pilocarpine and had the allergic reaction,  the redness etc. is gone, but I continue to have pain (sudden sharp pains, and pulsations/spasms). I am afraid to try pilocarpine again. He said sometimes you can take it for only 6 mo., and the pupil changes and contracts for reading; sometimes you need it indefinitely. Seems pretty powerful and scares me.   Also read of possible retinal detachment as side effect.  THis doctor also suggested replacing the lens with monofocal lens , but I can't understand the logic of that, if Restor is supposed to be the best choice for good near vision. He is considered a top doctor in NY, the Dr. FixIt that other doctors end problemic cases to!. I am now officially under his care. He also suggests a procedure to permanently contract the pupils if nothing else works. That seems far too drastic for me (pupilloplasty) and am afraid to such changes to my eye, and how that could effect both eyes, with one pupil smaller than the other.   I was never told had  ""large pupils ""  before (they don't look especially large or unusual) and never had any related problems with this before surgery?    Can the  cataract surgery change the way the pupil contracts? Did something go wrong during the surgery/? I had no complications after the surgery except problems with near/intermediate vision.Did I have a pre-=existing condition that i did n't know about? I've gotten no answers on this.    Another opinion said power of Restor lens was too weak, and recommends replacing lens with Restor at higher power.   But none of the other doctors mentioned anything about the lens being too weak (15.5D)     All of the doctors said that I would have trouble tolerating glasses/contacts, because there is a very wide divergence between the 2 eyes ( Ithink more than 5+ diopeters). .    The other eye also had a severe cataract which has gotten worse in the last year (the worsening of the cataracts in both eyes is what propelled me to have the surgery). I was supposed to have the 2nd eye done, but am postponing everything until it is clear what went wrong with the first surgery and what lens would be right.     Since the surgery, I use no glasses for distance, as my old glasses prescription  just blurs the eye that had the cataract removed. I read with the other eye, the one with the cataract, sometimes using my glasses, sometimes not. As with  the eye that  had the cataract, both eyes always enabled me to read comfortably, with mild Rx for reading or without reading glasses. I also sometimes try the over the counter reader for the eye that has the Restor lens, but  probably need a stronger one than I have-- but it helps..I use the reader for the computer. Obviously, using either of these glasses for reading only helps one eye, and the other is blurred as it is not the right Rx for the other eye..  Also  was told the many drops I've been taking since surgery had made my eye dry, so now I have been taking Systane.  I also tried Refresh, didn't seem very different from Systane. anyone with esperiences with these drops? Do you have to take them forever?    I am very frightened now of any more procedures-  such as replacing the lens (because I now have had  different suggestions as to what kind of lens with different MDs). The results of the surgery were unexpected, as I don't know if a replacement would help, or possibly create new, unexpected problems.    I am also afraid of doing the 2nd eye, as at least now I am assured that I can read with that eye. It frightens me to think that my natural reading ability could be decreased again.

I had d&c on 21 May and my first af came in 1st of July.

He gaved me pills to consume for 10 days. After the 10 days, I have to wait another 5 days and my first af finally came.
